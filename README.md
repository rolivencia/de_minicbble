# de_minicbble
An original defuse (de_) map created in September, 2005 for Counter-Strike 1.6 & Counter-Strike: Condition Zero

The czde_cbble.wad file must be copied to the /cstrike directory, together with the maps and overviews
folders, if it is used in Counter-Strike 1.6. This file is already added in Counter-Strike: Condition-Zero.

The source .rmf and .map files are available inside the /src folder. Feel free to edit and build your own customizations of this map.

## What is each file?

.nav - It's the file that bots used to know how to navigate through a map. It is required for the 1.6 bots to avoid them behaving awkwardly.

.res - Lists the resources required by the game to be able to download all the map dependencies when downloading the map from a server when you don't have it in your computer.

.bsp - Compiled map. Ready to run in CS 1.6

.rmf - Source of the map. Can be opened with Valve Hammer Editor 3.5. It requires importing the Half-Life 1.1.1.0 textures (halflife.wad) and de_dust2 textures (de_dust2.wad)

.txt - Info file.
