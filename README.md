# de_minicbble
An original defuse (de_) map created in September, 2005 for **Counter-Strike 1.6** / **Counter-Strike: Condition Zero** and ported to **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive**.

## If you only want to play this in Counter-Strike 1.6:

The **czde_cbble.wad** file must be copied to the **/cstrike** directory, together with the **maps** and **overviews**
folders located in the **/cs** folder, if it is used in Counter-Strike 1.6. This file is already added in Counter-Strike: Condition-Zero.

## What is each file and what does each folder contain?

### CS:

**maps/de_minicbble.bsp** - Compiled map. Ready to run in Counter-Strike 1.6

**maps/de_minicbble.nav** - It's the file that bots used to know how to navigate through a map. It is required for the 1.6 bots to avoid them behaving awkwardly.

**maps/de_minicbble.res** - Lists the resources required by the game to be able to download all the map dependencies when downloading the map from a server when you don't have it in your computer.

**maps/de_minicbble.txt** - Info file that displays after starting/joining a game.

**overviews/de_minicbble.bmp** - Radar image used in-game.

**overviews/de_minicbble.txt** - Text file that controls the radar image.

**screenshots/** - Just what it's name says.

**czde_cbble.wad** - Wad file that contains the Condition-Zero de_cbble textures.

**src/de_minicbble.rmf** - Source of the map. Can be opened with Valve Hammer Editor 3.5. It requires importing the Half-Life 1.1.1.0 textures (**halflife.wad**) and the Condition-Zero de_cbble textures (**czde_cbble.wad**)

### CSGO:

**/materials** folder - Contains all the custom textures used to create the map.

**/radar** folder - Contains the .dds file and .txt file that is packed in the **.bsp** to display the in-game radar and the loading splash of the map.

**/src** folder - Contains the unpacked **.bsp** file, the compilation log and the **.vmf** file that can be opened using the Hammer Editor.
